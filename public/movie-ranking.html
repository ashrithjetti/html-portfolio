<h1>The Best Movies According to Ashrith</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>One Nenokkadine</h3>
<p>
  This is my favourite movie. <br />
  I love the beauty of film-making shown by the director
</p>

<h3>Baahubali</h3>
<p>
  The movie was an epitome for TFI. <br />Was equally competent with any other
  hollywood action film.
</p>

<h3>3 Idiots</h3>
<p>
  This movie was one learner in the time it was released. <br />It convyed a
  good message to show a change in the way we look at our education and learning
</p>
